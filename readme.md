Setup Improved


v1.2

Adds a lot more leader-civ memento combinations from @Renouf again! many thanks. Added AgeType to some tables so they can specify if a memento is only good on that age (attribute bonus ones)

v1.1

Adds a button toggle to turn on or off AI's getting mementos. It also adds support for adjusting new game parameters, since firaxis hardcoded it in the UI file, rather than in a db table. For any modders, you can now add a row to AdvancedParameters to the frontend table setting Advanced to 1, to have it show in the advanced setup.

v1.0

added in a bunch of leader memento combinations from @Renouf on CivFanatics Forums. Fixed bug that meant personas could be in same game when randomised. Fixed bug where mementos were selected according to civ, then civ was changed by priority checker, and mementos not updated.

v0.1

Edits the game setup menu so the AI start with mementos, and players can alter their mementos. A necessary part also was to
resolve the randomness of AI civs, setting their leader and civ values. These are now viewable on the advanced setup screen.

Leaders/civs now have possible mementos to choose from, and its setup so modders can make auxiliary mods that alter or add
additional combos.
